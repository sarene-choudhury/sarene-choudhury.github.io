![Bad Design](https://weblium.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/imgonline-com-ua-Compressed-tJjhmq71v4.jpg)

This is an example of a bad website design.  Most of the text is so small that it’s illegible, and the different colours of text are too bold to be read with ease.  The page is also extremely overcrowded, and looking at this website, you wouldn’t immediately know what it’s purpose is.  Even after a few minutes of looking at it without squinting, it is very difficult to navigate.  There is also a random list that doesn’t have a heading or title to define its purpose.  There’s too much going on in the screen and it is overall not user friendly.

This is an example of a good website design.  There’s helpful information on the home page, such as the just arrived section at the bottom.  Not only that, but the site uses blank space just as well as it does colours, words and images.  There’s enough filled space that the site doesn’t look empty, but the page is not overcrowded, leaving it with an end result that is easy to navigate.  If that wasn’t enough, it is also aesthetically pleasing with the colour scheme that isn’t harsh or too bright to look at.
